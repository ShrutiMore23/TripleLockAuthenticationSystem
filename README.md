## ⚙️ Project Implementation and Working

### Overview

The **Triple Lock Authentication System** uses a multi-factor authentication approach by combining:

- **Simple Password Authentication** — Traditional username and password login.

- **Color Pattern Selection** — Users select a sequence of colors as a second factor.

- **Image Pattern Drag-and-Drop Verification** — Users verify identity by dragging and dropping images in a specific order.
